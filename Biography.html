          <p>Carti began rapping at an early age under the name Sir Cartier. Much of his early work has been deleted from the Internet. He adopted the name Playboi Carti in 2012 and signed to rapper Father's underground label Awful Records. He began to attract attention in 2015 with his singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti" featuring Da$h and Maxo Kream, both of which were published to SoundCloud. Around this time, Carti frequently collaborated with artists in Atlanta's underground rap scene, including his cousin UnoTheActivist, ThouxanbanFauni, Yung Bans, Yachty, Ethereal, and producers Mexikodro, and his close comrade ICYTWAT.
